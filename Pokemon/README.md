This was a project I was inspired to start working on in 2022 when the Pokemon Company was having issues converting Pokemon from one game into another which seemed like a minisule problem and easily solvable. From there I wanted to try to memory optimize a pokmeon game while having easy toString methods that could be called to pass the required information between games. I drafted an inheritance map that could have been used and wrote the base for one aspect that would have been need; the Individual Values (IVs). In the game any instance of a Pokemon has inherent IVs for the six primary stats: Health Points (HP), Attack (ATT), Defense (DEF), Special Attack (SPA), Special Defense (SPD), and Speed (SPE). These values range between 0-31 which could be reprented in five binary bits and there being six I noticed that combined it would 30 bits which could fit within a 32 bit intiger with only 2 bits of padding. This was the spark that drove the creation of Pokemon_Stats_IV.cc by treating the uint32_t as a array and using bit opperations. More details are commented for each function and macro.
