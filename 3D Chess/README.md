This was originally planned as a 3D chess game that would have been useful in virtual reality in March of 2021. When going to publish I planned on a minor revision and a description of missing features that would need to be encorporated to meet my current coding standard. When attempting to review the project it was of such a lower quality that I felt compled to instead overhaul what was written and document the chages using Version Control.
